JazzAnalyze
============

Jazz analyzer practice tool for changes based playing. Ongoing development with whatever efficient excercises or tools 
that I believe benefit my practice and may potentially be use to others.

Current functionalities:

1) Anaylze a sequence of notes
  
Input is one measure of diatonic notes. Function takes in the letters and converts each note to their relative scale 
interval degrees to formulate and determine which modes and chords may be used over this measure. Useful to get used to quick changes based playing in Jazz when you have no idea whats going on with each measure.

2) Analyze a given chord type 

Determines which modes can be used on this chord. Also gives the relative scale 
degrees for chord tones that will work over this chord

3) Random Chord Generator

Generates a random sequence of chord changes for etude or arppeggio exercises.

4) Repertoire

Contains a queue to hold a list of standards or artists to transcribe and learn ranking by difficulty. Used to organize
practice time efficiently.
